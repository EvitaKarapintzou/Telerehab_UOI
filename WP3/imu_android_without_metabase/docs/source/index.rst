MetaWear Android API
====================
The MetaWear Android API provides a simple way to communicate with your MetaWear boards using an Android app.  This guide will cover the functionality 
of the Android API and how to setup your project to use the API.  If you are interested in the finer details of the library, the source code is 
available on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/mbientlab/Metawear-AndroidAPI>`_ and API documentation is on our 
`website <https://mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/android/latest/>`_.

We also have `iOS <https://mbientlab.com/iosdocs>`_ and `C++ <https://mbientlab.com/cppdocs>`_ APIs if Android is not your preferred platform.
